# Let-s-go-airlines
“Let’s Go Airlines” is an upcoming domestic airline company in India. They are planning to launch flight operations between major cities in India namely Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, etc. As part of their IT initiatives, Lets Go wants to build a web application to help their customers book flight tickets online. But before starting a full scale project, they would like to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with only the high priority features integral to the business. This is done to collect user feedback early in the process to reevaluate and plan the product roadmap accordingly.
